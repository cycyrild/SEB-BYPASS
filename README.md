# SEB Bypass
The Chrome extension "SEB Bypass" allows you to bypass the execution of quizzes in Safe Exam Browser (SEB). This extension allows users to take a Moodle quiz directly in their current browser instead of having to go through SEB's secure environment. It therefore offers a practical alternative for those who prefer to use their own browser or who encounter difficulties with SEB.
